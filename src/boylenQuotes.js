    "On refusing to call a timeout or insert a starter during a 4th quarter where his bench gave up a 13-point lead and a 16-0 run: \"I got 15 guys to develop and I’m going to play them in those moments and they’re going to learn how to play winning basketball. I never yanked guys, I’ve never done that. I’m not doing that.",
    "I can't play for them. They have to come out and do it.",
    "We have to come in tomorrow and go to work and then get on that bird and keep playing.",
    "There’s no shame in [losing to the league-worst Warriors] tonight. We played hard and we competed and we battled.",
    "I think [players] need to take more responsibility for their preparedness. I think they need to take more ownership of their readiness to play. The head coaches in this league have never been expected to coach effort. Effort has to come from each guy.",
    "We have to keep playing the way we’re playing. The wins will come...If you build it, they will come. You ever seen that movie?",
    "I coach by faith.",
    "After beating the Clippers without Kawhi Leonard, Patrick Beverley, and Lou Williams: \"Well, we didn’t have [Otto Porter Jr.] or Hutch or Gafford. So we can 'yeah, but it' a little bit too.",
    "Reporter asks why Chandler Hutchison didn't play. Boylen: \"He didn't play because I didn't put him in.",
    "Reporter asks why Denzel Valentine hadn't played for the first 15 games outside of garbage time? Boylen: \"Because I said so.",
    "We practice to not have timeouts. I'm not in fear mode that we don't have timeouts, because we're prepared to not have them.",
    "Calling a timeout with a minute left while his team was trailing by 25 points: \"I was trying to run something with my second group. I got a G-League guy in there who I haven't coached much on an ATO. I don't stop coaching the team because we're down. I've never done that, never will.",
    "Win the first quarter is a success plate to me.",
    "The growth plate, the area we have to grow is offensively.",
    "Hell yeah...That’s the growth plate for this team, physical toughness, mental toughness, and, again, a lot of good things.",
    "Me subbing [the starters out for most of a 56-point home loss] is saving them maybe. This is about honoring the game and doing the right things. I worked for Gregg Popovich. He subbed five guys a ton of times. Nobody says a word to him about it.",
    "I play [the starters] more [in a 56 point loss], we lose tonight and can’t practice tomorrow, we double-lose.",
    "We got a good group of guys and a good leadership group that has a sparkling of the layers of our team.",
    "I’m juiced, man. I’m jacked up about it.",
    "Asked why he played Wendell Carter only 14 minutes: \"Sometimes you learn by sitting too.",
    "We got a 6 [representing the Bulls' six rings] on the back of the (expletive) jersey. C’mon dude. C’mon man.",
    "A little adversity, a little tough time isn’t the end of the world. My job is to prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. These guys are men. I’m trying to prepare them for the road.",
    "Those plays that Wayne [Selden] did? That makes me want to play again. It does something to your nervous system. It makes you want to go out and dive on somebody",
    "We’re going to keep working and grinding and communicating and hugging and crying and laughing and moving forward",
    "There’s been a little shock and awe here. That’s the way I felt it needed to happen.",
    "Sharing and caring, executing our offense with a pure heart.",
    "We talk about being a pack of wolves, man.",
    "We’ve had some boots to asses and will continue to have that. We’ll handle that in practice.",
    "I judge this thing on how we practice and how we play. I don’t judge it on what we lose by.",
    "[Otto Porter Jr's] approach already is respected. His spirit is acknowledged. He’s got a brightness about him and a care factor.",
    "Hutch has got such a good spirit. I think to be a good NBA player, you’ve got to have a good spirit. His spirit is so positive. Shaq (Harrison) too is the same way. His spirit is so good",
    "[Chandler Hutchison's] heart’s here. His soul is awesome. It’s great.",
    "[Lauri Markkanen's] soul and spirit are big time.",
    "When your heart is pure and you care, I just think (points) happen for you. The ball finds you.",
    "[Robin Lopez] is a giving, caring person who’s a tough son of a bitch.",
    "Well, he’s, you know, [Zach LaVine's] got a great spirit.",
    "[Shaq Harrison's] spirit is so good.",
    "I always kind of said, defensively, [Shaq Harrison's] like a mad dog chasing a meat truck. But he’s playing within a system now. It’s great",
    "[Jakarr Sampson] was in our hearts and on our minds all year, not just because he was with our G League team, but because of what he did in training camp.",
    "Things don’t go unnoticed when you play good basketball with a pure heart.",
    "[Kris Dunn] is a vocal part of our meal room.",
    "On setting a goal of averaging an NBA-record 35 assists per game: \"I watched the films. I see the open shots we miss. I see the assists we have. I didn’t pull this number out of the air. This is something I think we can do.",
    "That’s my mentality, road-dog mentality.",
    "Boylen on an earthquake during the 2019 Las Vegas summer league: \"I just think it’s the awesome power of nature to think that something can move that building that much. It’s awe-inspiring to me.",
    "On opting not to use a timeout to stop an opposing run: \"I could’ve used one and didn’t...It was on my heart. It was on my mind."
