I never yanked guys, I\u2019ve never done that. I\u2019m not doing that.',"I can't play for them. They have to come out and do it.","We have to come in tomorrow and go to work and then get on that bird and keep playing.","There\u2019s no shame in [losing to the league-worst Warriors] tonight. We played hard and we competed and we battled.","I think [players] need to take more responsibility for their preparedness. I think they need to take more ownership of their readiness to play. The head coaches in this league have never been expected to coach effort. Effort has to come from each guy.","We have to keep playing the way we\u2019re playing. The wins will come...If you build it, they will come. You ever seen that movie?","I coach by faith.","After beating the Clippers without Kawhi Leonard, Patrick Beverley, and Lou Williams: \"Well, we didn\u2019t have [Otto Porter Jr.] or Hutch or Gafford. So we can 'yeah, but it' a little bit too.","Reporter asks why Chandler Hutchison didn't play. Boylen: \"He didn't play because I didn't put him in.","Reporter asks why Denzel Valentine hadn't played for the first 15 games outside of garbage time? Boylen: \"Because I said so.","We practice to not have timeouts. I'm not in fear mode that we don't have timeouts, because we're prepared to not have them.","Calling a timeout with a minute left while his team was trailing by 25 points: \"I was trying to run something with my second group. I got a G-League guy in there who I haven't coached much on an ATO. I don't stop coaching the team because we're down. I've never done that, never will.","Win the first quarter is a success plate to me.","The growth plate, the area we have to grow is offensively.","Hell yeah...That\u2019s the growth plate for this team, physical toughness, mental toughness, and, again, a lot of good things.","Me subbing [the starters out for most of a 56-point home loss] is saving them maybe. This is about honoring the game and doing the right things. I worked for Gregg Popovich. He subbed five guys a ton of times. Nobody says a word to him about it.","I play [the starters] more [in a 56 point loss], we lose tonight and can\u2019t practice tomorrow, we double-lose.","We got a good group of guys and a good leadership group that has a sparkling of the layers of our team.","I\u2019m juiced, man.

These guys are men. I\u2019m trying to prepare them for the road.","Those plays that Wayne [Selden] did? That makes me want to play again. It does something to your nervous system. It makes you want to go out and dive on somebody","We\u2019re going to keep working and grinding and communicating and hugging and crying and laughing and moving forward","There\u2019s been a little shock and awe here. That\u2019s the way I felt it needed to happen.","Sharing and caring, executing our offense with a pure heart.","We talk about being a pack of wolves, man.","We\u2019ve had some boots to asses and will continue to have that. We\u2019ll handle that in practice.","I judge this thing on how we practice and how we play. I don\u2019t judge it on what we lose by.","[Otto Porter Jr's] approach already is respected. His spirit is acknowledged. He\u2019s got a brightness about him and a care factor.","Hutch has got such a good spirit. I think to be a good NBA player, you\u2019ve got to have a good spirit. His spirit is so positive. Shaq (Harrison) too is the same way. His spirit is so good","[Chandler Hutchison's] heart\u2019s here. His soul is awesome. It\u2019s great.","[Lauri Markkanen's] soul and spirit are big time.","When your heart is pure and you care, I just think (points) happen for you. The ball finds you.","[Robin Lopez] is a giving, caring person who\u2019s a tough son of a bitch.","Well, he\u2019s, you know, [Zach LaVine's] got a great spirit.","[Shaq Harrison's] spirit is so good.","I always kind of said, defensively, [Shaq Harrison's] like a mad dog chasing a meat truck.

It\u2019s great","[Jakarr Sampson] was in our hearts and on our minds all year, not just because he was with our G League team, but because of what he did in training camp.","Things don\u2019t go unnoticed when you play good basketball with a pure heart.","[Kris Dunn] is a vocal part of our meal room.",'On setting a goal of averaging an NBA-record 35 assists per game: "I watched the films.
